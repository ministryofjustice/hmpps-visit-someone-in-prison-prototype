        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Our legal basis for processing your data</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">We collect personal data so that you can request to visit someone in prison. Prisons and Young Offender Institutions need this information to ensure visits are safe and secure for visitors, prisoners and staff.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">The data we collect may be shared with other government departments, agencies and public bodies. It may also be shared with our technology suppliers, for example our hosting provider.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">The organisations we share personal information with are:</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Where data processing happens in the US, suppliers need to meet the certification standards set out in the UK-US data bridge agreement. This facilitates flows of personal data to certified US companies that have opted in to the EU-US Data Privacy
